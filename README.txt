This project is currently in beta. Expect to see some bugs crawling around.

A description of Statiss can be found here: https://github.com/Hammoi/Statiss/wiki

Setup:
  On the Hypixel server, run /api new to generate an API key. If you already have one, skip this step.

  With SS installed, run /ssc setApiKey [key] to bind your key with the mod. This is required in order for the mod to function.

  Stalk other players using /ss [name]!

  (If the lookup process seems to be taking too long, try /ssc restartApi and check again.)
